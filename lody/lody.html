   			<h5>lo<span>dy</span></h5>
   			<p>I am Lody Mae Villaceran. I live in Kimaya Jasaan, Misamis Oriental, and I studied at the University of Science and Technology of the Southern Philippines (USTP). I am very punctual and want to finish my college course and do all what i want at the right time. I like to eat.
            I enjoy singing whenever I'm sad, watching movies, and cooking in my spare time. I am the youngest child of my parents and have two older sisters. I live in a small but happy family with my parents in the house. I am very specific in this world and have a unique personality compared to others. I am a very responsible and sympathetic person.</p>

            <h5>Eat<span>ing</span></h5>
            <p>It makes me feel good. When I eat healthy and take care of myself, I have more energy, look more alive, and am bound to be more confident. Healthy foods like fruits and vegetables make me feel good, and a lifestyle full of healthy eating can change someone's life for the better.</p>

            <h5>Sing<span>ing</span></h5>
            <p>When I sing, I put my whole soul into the song. Think about it: singing is not an involuntary bodily function; it requires a bit of effort and, for some, even courage. With the music, I express emotions that I might otherwise not be able to express.</p>

            <p>Many people think that watching movies is both pleasant and a great way to unwind. An alternative to anxiety loss is watching movies, which can help us forget about our problems. As was already mentioned, watching movies can be emotionally beneficial. We can decompress and find comfort in movies.</p>
